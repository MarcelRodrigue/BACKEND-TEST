do not delet this READ.md file since it is part of the test and you will receive this READ.me file as the result of our evaluation with our apretiations, if we decide to proceed to hire you 

### The challenge
Create a data base with 3 type of users 
-Admin-1(master) 
-Admin-2(base-admin)

Users should be able to:

- create and acount
- login into thier acount
- stayed login after they leave the site(remember me option)
- create an organisation acount and generate an organisation code
- [becomming an Admin-1 by creating thier oagnistion](from-here-they-have-same-abilities-as-(Admin-1))

- See all pages as needed

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge and help us understand your code better .

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect, being able  to see your limitations and areas you have to improve is something which separates good devs from the rest, this also help us find the right people to teach you the skills necessary.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
